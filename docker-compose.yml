  # LGTM Stack (Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus) - Simplified for dev
  # For now, excluding full LGTM stack to keep it lightweight as requested "Local Cloud", but keeping placeholders or basic setup is good. 
  # Starting with just the basics to avoid resource hogging, unless explicitly verified. 
  # User asked for "Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus (LGTM Stack)". I should probably include a pre-configured image or individual services.
  # Let's use a combined image or standard setup.
